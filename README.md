# Blob Color Emoji - SVGs
This is the repository where the unpolished SVGs for the emojis are stored.<br>
The emoji are either based on or directly from the [Noto Color Emoji](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/) before the Oreo update.<br>
Using SVGO is recommended before using them for anything.<br>

## Usage
Currently, there's no specific project that uses the svgs, but they can be used in the [Twemoji Color Font](https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font) project instead of the Twemoji, a way to compile a font from the SVGs without needing to change anything will be made later.
